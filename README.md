# JolieBlogs

Easy to use blog site with a front page and profile views. Built with flask with a flask-MySQL backend! Can also work with a classic MySQL backend.


## Prerequisites & Libraries

* JolieBlogs requires <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, a useful Python web framework.

* Pip install the following: flask, flask-mysqldb


## Instructions

Now that the above are installed, start flask-mysqldb with 'mysql-ctl start' from the command line.

Edit your dbhandler.py to connect to your database configuration.

When running the jolieblogs.sql script to set up your tables, a default user will be created with admin privileges and the following credentials:


Email: admin [at] admin [dot] com


Password: admin


This will allow you to create your own account, then sign into the default account to provide your new account with administrator privileges.
